# Architektur Eingebetteter Systeme

## Exercise 1: The first project in Quartus
### Task 1:
In this task, the following instructions were gone through:

[QuartusÂ® Prime Introduction Using VHDL Designs](https://web.archive.org/web/20230430074600/http://mems.ece.dal.ca/eced4260/QuartusPrime.pdf)

GPIO - PIN assignments can be taken from the manual for the board:

[DE10-Standard User Manual](https://web.archive.org/web/20230430073532/https%3A%2F%2Fftp.intel.com%2FPublic%2FPub%2Ffpgaup%2Fpub%2FIntel_Material%2FBoards%2FDE10-Standard%2FDE10_Standard_User_Manual.pdf)

> Device family: Cyclone V (E/GX/GT/SX/SE/ST)
> 
> Name: 5CSXFC6D6F31C6

### Task 2:
The LEDs 0-9 should now be connected directly to the buttons 0-9:

## Exercise 3: Latches, Flip-flops, and Registers
Here we will refer to the [Altera tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20230515085651/https://docplayer.net/storage/48/24659104/1684144559/zhY50kay0iTjk9UwB2LhbA/24659104.pdf). Work through
the tutorial Latches, Flip-flops, and Registers. The simulation steps and parts
IV and V of the tutorial are not necessary.
